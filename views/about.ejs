    "How Can I Help" is an application that allows students to offer and receive
    help to and from other students on various subjects and topics covered in
    tech. The idea grew organically due to the fact that student experience
    levels in programming boot camps come in various levels. To help 'bridge the
    gap' and help all students succeed, "How Can I Help" acts facilitates the
    idea of peer tutoring by letting students offer help before being asked for
    it.
