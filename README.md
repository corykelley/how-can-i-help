# How Can I Help?

"How Can I Help" is an application that allows students to offer and receive
help from other students on various subjects and topics covered in tech.

The idea grew organically due to the fact that student experience levels in
programming bootcamps come in various levels and varying styles of learning.
To help 'bridge the gap' and to help all students succeed, "How Can I Help"
facilitates the idea of peer tutoring by letting students offer help before
being asked for it.
