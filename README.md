# How Can I Help?

"How Can I Help" is an application that allows students to offer and receive help to and from other students on various subjects and topics covered in tech.

The idea grew organically due to the fact that student experience levels in programming boot camps come in various levels. To help 'bridge the gap' and help all students succeed, "How Can I Help" acts facilitates the idea of peer tutoring by letting students offer help before being asked for it.
